			<p><em>The following is a transcript of Donald J. Trump’s election victory speech.</em></p>
			<hr>
			<p>Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. Sorry to keep you waiting. Complicated business, complicated. Thank you very much. I've just <span class="highlight">received a call from Secretary Clinton</span>. She congratulated us.</p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>Trump and his associates continue to attack his former Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, calling for investigations into funding from Clinton's campaign and the DNC for the research behind the Trump/Russia dossier and questioning Clinton's involvement in the Uranium One deal.</p>
			</div>

			<p>It is about us. On our victory, and I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard-fought campaign I mean she fought very hard. <span class="highlight">Hillary has worked very long and very hard</span> over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country.</p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>Clinton retreated to the woods of Chappaqua during the first months of Trump’s fledgling presidency. She made few public appearances other than Trump’s inauguration. More recently, Clinton has thrust herself back into the public eye, releasing a book titled “What Happened,” her take on the tumultuous election that resulted in a Trump win. </p>
			</div>

			<p>I mean that very sincerely. Now it is time for America to bind the wounds of division, have to get together, to all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation I say it is time for us to come together as one united people. It’s time. I pledge to every citizen of our land that <span class="highlight">I will be president for all of Americans</span>, and this is so important to me.</p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>Trump has been called divisive by everyone from Gold Star Families to NFL commissioner Roger Goodell. A recent poll by The Washington Post-University of Maryland, conducted nine months into Trump's presidency, found that 70% of Americans say the nation’s political divisions are at least as big as during the Vietnam War.</p>
			</div>

			<p>For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people, <span class="highlight">I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country.</span></p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/868985285207629825
https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/916638685914951680
A frustrated Trump, upset over Republicans’ inability to repeal and replace Obamacare, said this month that he had reached out to Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) in hopes of brokering a deal for a "great HealthCare Bill." Despite occasionally reaching across the aisle, the President  has continued to use the heated, inflammatory rhetoric that became a staple of his campaign rallies, attacking his former election opponent, railing against the “fake news” media, protesters, Muslims, Mexican immigrants and NFL players.</p>
			</div>

			<p>As I've said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign but rather an incredible and great movement, made up of millions of hard-working men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their family.</p>
			<p><span class="highlight">It’s a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds and beliefs</span>, who want and expect our government to serve the people, and serve the people it will.</p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>Forty-nine percent of voters believe Trump should be impeached, compared to only 41 percent who oppose the measure, according to a new national survey by Public Policy Polling. His overall approval rating has dipped to 38 percent.</p>
			</div>

			<p>Working together we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I've spent my entire life in business, looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world.</p>
			<p>That is now what I want to do for our country. Tremendous potential. I've gotten to know our country so well. Tremendous potential. It is going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.</p>
			<p>We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. <span class="highlight">We're going to rebuild our infrastructure</span>, which will become, by the way, second to none, and we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.</p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/873643935993708544
Infrastructure week didn’t quite go as planned.Trump touted an infrastructure plan throughout the campaign that promised to combine private and public funds. A White House spending proposal in May included a brand new section that would “provide an infrastructure plan to support $1 trillion in private/public infrastructure investment.” That plan was scrapped this month when Trump told members of the House Ways and Means Committee last week that he no longer favored private investment.</p>
			</div>

			<p>We will also finally take care of our great veterans who have been so loyal, and I've gotten to know so many over this 18-month journey. The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors. <span class="highlight">Our veterans are incredible people.</span></p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>Trump has touted changes and reforms at the Department of Veterans Affairs despite nominating Obama holdover David Shulkin as secretary. https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/893170489820151808</p>
			</div>

			<p>We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It is going to happen. <span class="highlight">We have a great economic plan.</span></p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>Despite having a Republican majority in both houses, Trump has been unable to claim any legislative victories. The GOP is hammering out a tax reform plan that Trump wants on his desk before Christmas.</p>
			</div>

			<p>We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time we will get along with all other nations, willing to get along with us. We will be. We will have great relationships. <span class="highlight">We expect to have great, great relationships.</span></p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>Trump has sown a sense of uncertainty on the international stage after pulling the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord, engaging in a series of embarrassing phone calls with world leaders and threatening to pull out of longstanding trade deals such as NAFTA.</p>
			</div>

			<p>No dream is too big, no challenge is too great. Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach. America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. We must reclaim our country's destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We're going to dream of things for our country, and beautiful things and successful things once again.</p>
			<p>I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone. All people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility, partnership, not conflict.</p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>In September, Trump delivered one of his most stunning speeches yet as president. Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Trump vowed to “totally destroy” North Korea  if the rogue country doesn’t reign in its nuclear weapons program. He has also vowed to “decertify” the international deal regarding Iran’s nuclear program, drawing condemnation from allies and critics alike.</p>
			</div>

			<p>And now I would like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight very, very historic victory. First I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on me right now. Great people. I've learned so much from them. They were wonderful in every regard. I had truly great parents.</p>
			<p>I also want to thank my sisters, Marianne and Elizabeth who are here with us tonight. And -- Where are they? They're here someplace. They're very shy actually. And my brother Robert, my great friend. <span class="highlight">Where is Robert? Where is Robert?</span> My brother Robert, and they should all be on this stage, but that's okay. They're great.</p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>Where is Robert, indeed. Trump’s younger brother and his two sisters have maintained a low profile throughout the first nine months of their sibling’s term in office.</p>
			</div>

			<p>And also <span class="highlight">my late brother Fred</span>, great guy. Fantastic guy. Fantastic family. I was very lucky.</p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>During an Oct. 26 speech declaring the nation’s opioid epidemic a public health emergency, Trump invoked the story of his late brother, Fred Trump, who died of complications related to alcoholism. The President credited Fred for warning him against drinking and called for an advertising campaign he believes will keep people from becoming addicted to opioids and other drugs. “I learned because of Fred; I learned,” Trump said.</p>
			</div>

			<p>Great brothers, sisters, great, unbelievable parents. To Melania and Don and <span class="highlight">Ivanka</span> and Eric and Tiffany and Barron, I love you and I thank you, and especially for putting up with all of those hours. This was tough. This was tough. This political stuff is nasty and it is tough. So I want to thank my family very much. Really fantastic.</p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>Trump kept his daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner close, giving them both advisory roles in the White House. But, frustrated by special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s meddling in the election and possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin, <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/president-trump-blames-son-in-law-jared-kushner-mueller-probe-article-1.3604438">Trump has grown wary of Kushner’s influence.</a></p>
			</div>

			<p>Thank you all. Thank you all. And Lara, unbelievable job. Unbelievable. Vanessa, thank you. Thank you very much. What a great group. You've all given me such incredible support, and I will tell you that we have a large group of people. You know, they kept saying we have a small staff. Not so small. Look at all of the people that we have. Look at all of these people. And  <span class="highlight">Kellyanne and Chris and Rudy and Steve</span> and David.</p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>Trump appears to have given brief shoutouts to his White House counselor Kellyanne Conway and his soon-to-be former chief strategist Stephen Bannon, who has since returned to his post as head of alt-right Breitbart. Conway continues to appear as a Trump surrogate on TV, despite her disdain for “fake news” media, frequently targeting Clinton and other Trump opponents.</p>
			</div>

			<p>We have got tremendously talented people up here, and I want to tell you it's been very, very special. I want to give a very special thanks to our former mayor, Rudy Giuliani. He's unbelievable. Unbelievable. He traveled with us and he went through meetings, and Rudy never changes. <span class="highlight">Where is Rudy?</span> Where is he?</p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>A constant companion during Trump’s campaign, Giuliani was rumored to be one of Trump’s top picks for attorney general. The former New York mayor didn’t get the gig, something he may be secretly pleased with after the troubles faced by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.</p>
			</div>

			<p><span class="highlight">Governor Chris Christie</span>, folks, was unbelievable. Thank you, Chris.</p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>The New Jersey governor, passed over for a cabinet position, remains a staunch supporters of the President and helms his opioid commission. On Nov. 1, the commission released its final report. Christie backed Trump’s decision to declare a public health emergency, despite the lack of federal funds associated with the designation. Christie said Trump’s emergency declaration was the president’s way of “handing the baton to Congress.”</p>
			</div>

			<p>The first man, first senator, first major, major politician -- let me tell you, he is highly respected in Washington because he is as smart as you get, senator <span class="highlight">Jeff Sessions</span>. Where is Jeff?</p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>Trump spent the summer publicly shaming and attacking his top prosecutor for recusing himself from the ongoing Russia probe. Sessions has come under renewed scrutiny in recent days after it was reported that he shot down a suggestion from an adviser that Trump meet with Putin during a 2016 campaign meeting. Sessions has said under oath that he knew of no one in the campaign who had “conversation with any Russians or any foreign officials.” George Papadopoulos, the adviser who offered to set up the meeting between Trump and Putin was arrested in July for lying to the FBI. His guilty plea indicates he’s cooperating with federal investigators.</p>
			</div>

			<p>A great man. Another great man, very tough competitor. He was not easy. He was not easy. Who is that? Is that the mayor that showed up? Is that Rudy? Oh, Rudy got up here. Another great man who has been really a friend to me, but I'll Tell you, I got to know him as a competitor, because he was one of the folks that was negotiating to go against those democrats. <span class="highlight">Dr. Ben Carson</span>. Where is Ben? Where is Ben?</p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>The neurosurgeon is serving as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. The Trump Administration has proposed a $6 billion, or 13%, cut to HUD’s budget next fiscal year.</p>
			</div>

			<p>By the way, <span class="highlight">Mike Huckabee</span> is here someplace, and he is fantastic. Mike and his family, Sarah, thank you very much.</p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>The former Arkansas governor, an early Trump supporter, is now hosting a talk show on the Christian Trinity Broadcasting Network. His daughter, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, is the White House press secretary. She took over the role after Sean Spicer resigned in July.</p>
			</div>

			<p><span class="highlight">General Mike Flynn</span>. Where is Mike?</p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>Trump’s disgraced national security advisor is believed to be at the center of Mueller’s Russia probe. Flynn  stepped down in February after less than a month on the job after he was caught lying about contacts with Russian officials. The former Army general was also paid more than $500,000 in 2016 for lobbying that benefitted the Turkish government and discredited U.S.-based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen.</p>
			</div>

			<p>And <span class="highlight">General Kellogg.</span></p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>Mueller’s team recently interviewed retired Army general Keith Kellogg, the chief of staff of the White House National Security Council under both Flynn and his successor, H.R. McMaster.</p>
			</div>

			<p>We have over 200 generals and admirals that have endorsed our campaign, and they're special people and it is really an honor. We have 22 congressional medal of honor recipients.</p>
			<p>We have just tremendous people. A very special person who believe me, and, you know, I would read reports that I wasn't getting along with him. I never had a bad second with him. He's an unbelievable star. He is -- that's right, how did you possibly guess? <span class="highlight">So let me tell you about Reince</span>, and I have said this. I said, reince -- and I know it, I know it. Look at all of those people over there. I know it. Rience is a superstar, but I said they can't call you a superstar, Reince, unless we win. Because you can't be called a superstar, like Secretariat, if Secretariat came in second, would not have the beautiful bronze bust at the track at belmont.</p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>Priebus served as Trump’s first chief of staff, overseeing a tumultuous tenure in the White House. He recently announced that he is rejoining a Wisconsin-based law firm as president and chief strategist and is signing with the Washington Speakers Bureau. His time with Trump was beset with stories of strife as he attempted to reign in warring factions within the West Wing. His replacement, retired general John Kelly, has only added to the chaos in recent weeks by making public statements attacking a Florida Congresswoman and calling Confederate general Robert E. Lee an “honorable man.”</p>
			</div>

			<p>But I will tell you Reince is really a star. And he is the hardest working guy, and in a certain way I did this -- where is reince? Get up here, Reince. Get over here, Reince. Boy, oh boy. It is about time you did this, Reince. Huh, my God. Say a few words.</p>
			<p>REINCE PRIEBUS: No, no, no.</p>
			<p>DONALD TRUMP: No, come on, say something.</p>
			<p>REINCE PRIEBUS: Ladies and gentlemen, the next president of the United States, Donald Trump! Thank you. It's been an honor. God bless. Thank God. You bet.</p>
			<p>DONALD TRUMP: Amazing guy. Our partnership with the RNC was so important to the success in what we have done. So I also have to say I've gotten to know some incredible people, the <span class="highlight">Secret Service</span> people. They're tough and they're smart and they're sharp, and I don't want to mess around with them, I can tell you.</p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>President Trump’s penchant for weekends away from the White House have reportedly brought the Secret Service to the edge of bankruptcy. The agency has placed caps on overtime for agents and taken other measures to cut costs. Trump’s trips to his properties, including weekends in Florida, New Jersey and Virginia have added up. According to reports, the Secret Service spent $59,585 on golf cart rentals alone through August. The agency was also booted from their command post in Trump Tower due to a rent disagreement with the building.</p>
			</div>

			<p>And when I want to go and wave to a big group of people and they rip me down and put me back down in the seat, but they are fantastic people. So I want to thank the secret service. And law enforcement in New York City, they're here tonight. These are spectacular people, sometimes underappreciated unfortunately, but we appreciate them.</p>
			<p>We know what they go through. So it has been what they call a historic event, but to be really historic we have to do a great job. And I promise you that I will not let you down. We will do a great job. We will do a great job. I look very much forward to being your president, and <span class="highlight">hopefully at the end of two years or three years or four years, or maybe even eight years</span>, you will say, so many of you worked so hard for us, but you will say that that was something that you really were very proud to do, and I can thank you very much.</p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>Christie suggested last week that he isn’t sure if Trump will seek a second term. The President has already held several fundraisers, filling his coffers with millions for another run. But Christie said four years is a long time in the White House for a political neophyte like the President. <a href="https://www.today.com/video/new-jersey-gov-chris-christie-on-rebuilding-after-hurricane-sandy-5-years-later-1082755651831">“If he runs again I would support him, yes, but I'm not so sure what would happen," Christie told NBC’s “Today Show.”</a></p>
			</div>

			<p>I can only say that while the campaign is over, our work on this movement is now really just beginning. We're going to get to work immediately for the American people, and we're going to be doing a job that, hopefully, you will be so proud of your president, you will be so proud. Again, it’s my honor. It was an amazing evening. It's been an amazing two-year period, and I love this country.</p>
			<p>Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you to <span class="highlight">Mike Pence</span>. Thank you to everybody.</p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>Vice President Pence was brought on to the Trump ticket by none other than Paul Manafort, the former campaign chairman recently indicted on 12 federal charges including money laundering. Pence has maintained his role as a loyal right-hand man to the President even as Trump has reportedly mocked his Veep’s deeply held religious views and <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/trump-joked-pence-wanting-gay-people-hang-article-1.356642">even joked that Pence wants to “hang” gay people.</a></p>
